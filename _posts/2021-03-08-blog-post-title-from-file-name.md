Hello! My name is Genesis Rodriguez I am a freshman majoring in nursing, I hope to graduate 2029. 
My goal in life is to complete my education and get the career that I want. I am planning to become a pediatric nurse and work with children, learning also more about health. I hope to be successful in life and enjoy living.

A couple of hobbies of mine are cooking, exercising, and nails. I really enjoy cooking, especially for my family, I find it relaxing and fun learning about different foods I can make. I recently started going to the gym in the summer and I thought I would hate it but it is actually very peaceful. It takes a little to get consistent but it gets easy and i think it has a great impact on my mental health and health overall. I also have a business, I do acrylic nails, I began this May of 2024 and so far its been great and I love learning new things I enjoy.

So far my favorite subject in college is Anatomy and physiology overall, I find it interesting learning about the body and its interesting facts on how the body functions.
